##Description

[JQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin to create dropdown menus from ul lists.

This is a very simple and straightforward plugin. It's still a work in progress project
with more features to come, so check for updates to see what's new in upcoming versions.

##Requirements

This is a [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin, so obviously it requires the jquery library.

##Usage

Add jquery and mnmenu scripts to the <head> section.
``<script src="../lib/jqmin.1.10.1.js" type="text/javascript"></script>``
``<script src="../src/jquery.mnmenu.js" type="text/javascript"></script>``
